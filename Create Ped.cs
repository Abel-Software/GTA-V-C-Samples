Ped mora = World.CreatePed("MODEL_GOES_HERE", World.GetNextPositionOnStreet(Game.Player.Character.Position.Around(5f));

//Use model list from https://github.com/AbelSoftware/NativeXperience and replace "MODEL_GOES_HERE" with the model you want to spawn the ped with
//**Note**: This is not to change your player model. I have posted a different code for that!
